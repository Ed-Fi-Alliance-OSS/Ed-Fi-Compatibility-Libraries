# Ed-Fi-Compatibility-Libraries

Shared libraries for backward compatibility support

## Developer Notes

* Although this is called "53" it applies to ODS/API 5.4 as well.
* Running the integration tests requires presence of SQL Server and PostgreSQL
  instances with the EdFi_Security database from 5.3 or 5.4.
* Release process does not match our ideal scenario in other repositories.
  * Create a Pre-release
  * Automatically builds and publishes a NuGet package with the version number
    from `Directory.Build.props`
  * If everything looks good, then change to a release, and
  * In Azure Artifacts, promote the new NuGet package to the Release view.
